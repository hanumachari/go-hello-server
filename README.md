# Simple Go HTTP Server  

This is a basic HTTP server written in Go that listens on port 8080 and responds with `"Hello, World!"` to any request.  

## Prerequisites  
- Go (>=1.16) installed on your machine  
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)  

## Installation & Running  

### 1. Clone the Repository (Optional)  
If you haven't already cloned the repository, run:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hanumachari/hello-world.git
cd hello-world 

### 2. Run the Server
Execute the following command to start the server:

go run main.go
You should see this output:
Server is running on port 8080...
### 3. Test the Server
Open your browser or use curl to test:
curl http://localhost:8080
Expected output:
Hello, World!

### 4. Building the Binary
To compile the server into an executable, run:
go build -o server

Then run the binary:
./server


Docker Support
To containerize the application using Docker, create a Dockerfile with:
Build and run the container:
docker build -t go-server .
docker run -p 8080:8080 go-server
